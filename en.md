WordPress is world wide the most used content management system. The system uses the commonly known combination of PHP and MySQL and therefore runs on almost every hosts webspace.

Originally designed as a pure blog-system, WordPress rapidly spread out in the world of blogs and slowly converted into an adequate CMS. Today you can use WordPress to build complex websites, shops and communities, just like that.


## User-friendly expandability
The development of the backend, the surface for technical and content management, follows the philosophy “decisions, not options”, and therefore makes the content development within the „naked“ system deceptively easy. 
WordPress generally distinguishes between static sites and dynamic articles. Those can easily be written in a simple editor and supported with pictures as well as other data.
Articles are automatically listed on the homepage in chronological order by date. 

There are thousands of extensions for needs wich exceed the basic functions, called Plugins, in the central Plugin Directory at WordPress.org, available for free.
You can download and install those extensions directly out of the directory within the WordPress backend or manually via FTP onto your server. If needed, plugins can be updated with a single mouse click. Crucial security-updates will be installed automatically. 

By now there are very good, free plugins for the most important applications. The sheer number of high quality and fully developed as well as frequent updated plugins for common applications like search engine optimization, multilingualism, or e-commerce, is overwhelming. Additional to the thousand free plugins WordPress has it’s own ecosystem of chargeable plugins which are sold through a variety of different platforms. 

The topic design, in WordPress called themes, is covered though an immense selection, as well. 
Free of charge Themes are, like plugins, mostly found in the central theme directory at WordPress.org. Additionally to thousands of free themes are a huge variety of chargeable options. However, the development of your own themes is with basic PHP- HTML-  and CSS-knowledge, thanks to plenty of templates and detailed instructions easily possible. By now, most of all new themes are responsive, meaning they adapt to the display width and optimized for most devices like tablets or phones. 


## Simple architecture
Even complex adjustments, which exceed the range of existing plugins are easily made. This is possible with the use of so-called hooks and filters. With the use of those you can inject your code almost anywhere in WordPress.

A whole catalog of good documented functions, enables theme- as well as plugin-developers the simple and safe use of important basic functions. 

The use of WordPress as a platform for complex web applications and apps is now, thanks to a new interface, the so-called REST API even easier. Through this interface it is not only possible to use WordPress as a content management system for several channels (web, apps, etc.), but also the exchange of data between WordPress and other services is now easier and more reliable.


## Services for WordPress
Besides plugins and themes the WordPress ecosystem has a range of external services to offer. On the one hand, services which are embedded like plugins and for example enable the option for automatic backups, the compression of uploaded pictures or the distribution of newsletters. 
On the other hand, there has been a movement within the past years to provide services like frequent maintenance, translation or the professional development of individual themes, which you can choose from today.


## Mobile apps
There are Apps to operate your WordPress on a mobile device for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Blackberry. However, the WordPress backend is designed for a comfortable use on mobile devices without any apps and allows you to edit your content as well as to manage your installations.


## Community
WordPress is available in over 50 languages and has a huge user-/developer-community worldwide. In addition to the excellent documentation on WordPress.org there are a multitude of professionals blogs, forums, chats, seminars, webinars, literatures and videos. Furthermore there is a movement to start more and more local user-groups, which organize themselves in so-called WordPress Meetups.

Worldwide you can find over 800 Meetups in bigger cities and other popular places, where WordPress interested developers, users and designer regularly work in easy-going, self-organized groups to solve problems and discuss selected topics.

In addition there are nationwide as well as international and local WordCamps - Barcamps for WordPress-users and developers which take place in different locations.
